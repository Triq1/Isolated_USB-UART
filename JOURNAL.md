This is my journal of the design and building process of **Isolated USB_UART**.

## 10/20/2025 - Schematic Time!  

First schematic design using parts I have on hand.

We use an isolated power converter and a dual channel data isolator and that makes our job very easy.

The actual USB_UART stuff uses a CH340N. Decoupling is given to each IC, and the DC-DC converter gets a 10 uF cap on each side as specced in its datasheet. Simples!
