This is my journal of the design and building process of **Isolated USB_UART**.

## 10/20/2025 7 PM - Schematic Time!  

First schematic design using parts I have on hand.

We use an isolated power converter and a dual channel data isolator and that makes our job very easy.

The actual USB_UART stuff uses a CH340N. Decoupling is given to each IC, and the DC-DC converter gets a 10 uF cap on each side as specced in its datasheet. Simples!

## 10/20/2025 10 PM - Started Soldering  

Decided to make it on prototyping board rather than an actual PCB to save time. I might do a board later.

Instead of a real USB port, an old cable was chopped and soldered directly. This is a regrettable decision overall, but it does work.

The isolated DC-DC converter was confirmed to work perfectly, and the CH340N enumerates as a COM port (as expected). The isolated data converter is yet to be tested.
